# personalizer

> This proof of concept demonstrates how anonymous data collected through normal web analytics can be used to personalize the user experience. Depending on which province a user arrives from, the default language setting in their web browser, and the time of year in which they arrive, they will be served a list of links to benefits that are most commonly visited by people like them. The model to deliver these personalized results is trained on two years&#x27; worth of previous visitors to these benefit pages.
